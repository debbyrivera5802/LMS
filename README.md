This software will be for managing and keeping track of a library's collection of books. 
The system users can include librarians, teachers, students, and any civilian that is looking for a book to rent out or read.
The librarians should be able to add new or returning books into its database.
In the database each book should have its own ID number, title, and author. There should be an option that displays all books currently in the library.
